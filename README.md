Module 2 Challenge - by William Fetter

Objectives: Use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

Requirements: 
    Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

      - The ticker symbol
      - Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
      - The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
      - The total stock volume of the stock. 
      - Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 
      - Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.
      - Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
      - Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. 
      - Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet.
